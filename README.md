## What is this?

This is a TDD React single page application using Redux for state management. It is test driven using Enzyme and Jest.

It is based on a [tutorial on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/) by [Bonnie Schulkin](https://github.com/flyrightsister) which I thoroughly recommend.

## Learning Outcomes

* Testing single page application which loads data from a server
* Using Redux middleware
* Best practices when building a React app (parent and child components)
